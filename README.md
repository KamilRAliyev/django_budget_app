# django_budget_app
 Simple app for budget management , that I wrote when I was learning Django

We are going to build a budget application where the user can start new project and track information about the budget.
1) Will display the amount of money they have at a moment.
2) Track the information about the expenses.
3) Calculate how much money he/she can spend with out going to break.
